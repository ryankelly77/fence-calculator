- [x] Netlify account (free)
- [x] GitHub account (for auto-deploy)

### Method 1: GitHub Integration (Best for Updates)

#### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository
1. Ensure your code is in a GitHub repository
2. Your project already has these files configured:
   - âœ… `netlify.toml` (build settings)
   - âœ… `_redirects` (SPA routing)
   - âœ… `package.json` (dependencies)

#### Step 2: Connect Netlify to GitHub
1. Visit [app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com)
2. Sign up with GitHub (or email)
3. Click "Add new site"
4. Select "Import an existing project"
5. Choose "Deploy with GitHub"
6. Authorize Netlify access
7. Select your repository

#### Step 3: Configure Deployment
Netlify will auto-detect these settings (already configured):
- **Build command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish directory**: `dist`
- **Branch**: `main`

Just click "Deploy site"!

#### Step 4: Monitor Build
1. Watch the deploy log in real-time
2. Build takes 1-3 minutes
3. Green checkmark = success!

#### Step 5: Access Your Live Site
1. Click the generated URL (e.g., `https://amazing-site-123.netlify.app`)
2. Your React app is now live! ðŸŽ‰

### Method 2: Manual Drag & Drop

#### Step 1: Build Locally
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create production build
npm run build
```
This creates a `dist` folder with your built app.

#### Step 2: Deploy to Netlify
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Sign up for free account
3. On dashboard, find "Want to deploy a new site without connecting to Git?"
4. Drag your `dist` folder to the deploy box
5. Site goes live immediately!

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails?

git add .
git commit -m "Update feature"
git push origin main
# Netlify automatically rebuilds and deploys!
```
